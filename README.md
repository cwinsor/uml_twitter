# **The GC19HG Project - Preprocessing and Model Development**

GC19HG (GeoCovid19 Heterogeneous Graph) is a social media research project that seeks to understand how the micro-level behaviors of millions of users combine into macro-level topic trends. The work uses the CrisisNLP GeoCov19 dataset - a set of tweets relating to Covid19 from February to May of 2020.

Our approach combines heterogeneous graph machine learning, NLP pre-trained models and self-supervised learning using the PyTorch Geometric (PyG) library. The code here performs preprocessing of the raw data and establishes an initial modeling attempt.

The code can be run from a Google Colab notebook with launcher at https://github.com/cwinsor/uml_twitter/blob/main/colab_notebook_launcher.ipynb
